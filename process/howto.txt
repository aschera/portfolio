#How to Deploy to Github-Pages with a Master Branch and Docs folder:

On your master branch, run the terminal command: `npm run build`.

Change the name of your `dist` folder to `docs`

In your newly created `docs` folder, go to the index.html and remove the `/` in the beginning of every script and link tag’s `src` attribute.

Go to your repository’s settings.

Scroll to the Github Pages settings.

Change your `Source` in your Github Pages settings from `gh-pages branch` to `master branch/docs folder`.

Now, you can push your master branch to github, and it will be hosted by Github Pages.

If you want to make a change to your master branch and have it detected by Github Pages, you’ll need to delete your docs folder, and follow the instructions from step 1.
